The story of planetary science can be divided into three fairly well-defined periods. Before 1610 all that could be done was to study the planetary movements; without optical aid it was impossible to learn anything about their physical characteristics. Between 1610 and 1962 equipment of all sorts could be used, and a great deal was found out, though it is true that some of our theories proposed as recently as the 1950s have proved to be very wide of the mark. Then, in 1962, came the first successful planetary probe — America's Mariner 2, to Venus — and since then we have depended very largely upon the results provided by the spacecraft. Only Pluto of the nine main planets has yet to be bypassed at close range (and there is, moreover, a serious doubt as to whether Pluto is worthy of true planetary status).
